# Impactor 25

**Impactor 25** is an advanced asteroid impact simulation application that provides realistic calculations and visualizations of potential asteroid impacts on Earth.

## Features

- Real-time NASA NEO (Near-Earth Object) data integration
- Advanced physics-based impact calculations
- Interactive impact visualization with maps
- AI-powered analysis using Google Gemini Pro
- Responsive design with modern UI components

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library
- **Google Gemini AI** - Enhanced impact analysis
- **NASA NEO API** - Real asteroid data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How It Works

Impactor 25 uses scientifically accurate formulas to calculate:
- Impact energy based on asteroid mass and velocity
- Crater diameter using scaling laws
- Destruction radius and affected areas
- Environmental effects and consequences

The application integrates with NASA's Near-Earth Object API to provide real asteroid data and uses Google's Gemini Pro AI to enhance the analysis with detailed scientific explanations.
